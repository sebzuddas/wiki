# What is Docker?
Docker is a containerisation software which enables you to develop apps and run them in an environment that is contained. It is an alternative to virtual machines. 

# Images
Images represent a docker container in a standardised way. They are immutable, just like a picture. You can add things to the image in layers. Each `RUN` command adds a new layer to the image. 

Layers represent slight changes that are added to each image.
