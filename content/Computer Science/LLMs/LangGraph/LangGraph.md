# What is LangGraph?
LangGraph is an orchestration framework for complex agentic systems and is more low-level and controllable than LangChain agents. On the other hand, LangChain provides a standard interface to interact with models and other components, useful for straight-forward chains and retrieval flows.

# Why use LangGraph?
Other agentic frameworks can work for simple, generic tasks but fall short for complex tasks bespoke to a company’s needs. LangGraph provides a more expressive framework to handle companies’ unique tasks without restricting users to a single black-box cognitive architecture.
