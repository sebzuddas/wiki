# What is the Internet of Things
The internet of things is a phenomenon whereby traditionally 'dumb' devices are 'smartified' after having been connected with the internet, and where these devices can communicate with one another, through [[Internet Protocol (IP)]], [[Zigbee]], [[MATTR]] and other protocols. 

The deployment of IoT devices can lead to a [[Systems of Systems]], with [[networks]] of [[sensors]] and [[actuators]].
