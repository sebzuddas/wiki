# What is this Wiki?
This is a place where I plan to structure and share my knowledge. To do this, I use a 'structure as is needed' approach. This is an ongoing process of moving knowledge from other places into this wiki, so progress will be gradual. 

# Why not use Wikipedia?
Wikipedia is great, but there is too much variation in page quality. Some pages are extensive, having been written and edited by experts. If you're expert in a domain and come across a page written by experts, then it's fine. Other pages however are written by non-experts, usually taking from textbooks. This is fine, but they will miss how the topic maps to more fundamental principles. And if you're there to learn but the references are hard to understand, then it's a problem. Similarly, different experts are used to using different mathematical notation and this can lead to confusion when trying to map fundamentals to applications. 

I'm taking the approach of 'if I was to learn what I know now from the start, how would I approach it?' -  by mapping and building on fundamentals in an intuitive way. Also, when learning new things, they can be mapped, easily, to fundamental principles. It's the all-in-one textbook I wish I could have used. 

Further, with this wiki being easily accessible online, it can serve the purpose of refreshing understanding of a complex topic, and where it comes from, relatively quickly. Whereas Wikipedia will have entire sections on the history of topics, this wiki will focus on applications. Further to that, having ready-to-use applications for these complex topics will enable a quick copy/paste/apply approach.
