# Datatypes
## Raster
Raster data splits an area into a grid, like an [[Agent-based Modelling (ABM)|Agent-based model]]'s discrete environment. This is a finite, discrete set of datapoints. It is basically a matrix. 
## Vectors
More information regarding vectors can be found [here](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/vector_attribute_data.html).
Features, such as a house are represented by vector data. Vectors as *points* in GIS take the standard form an $[x, y, z]$ vector in $\mathbb R ^3$. "Imagine standing on a hill". Each point is defined as a vector. Linking the points results in shapes such as lines, polylines, or polygons. You can also have vectors take other forms, where other attributes of a given feature such as a house's colour is stored in the vector.
