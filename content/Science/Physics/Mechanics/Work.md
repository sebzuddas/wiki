# What is Work?
Work in physics is quantitative. **It defines the magnitude of energy that is associated with an object's displacement after subjecting it to an external force**. **work** is the [[Energy]] transferred to or from an [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_object "Physical object") via the application of [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") along a [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_\(vector\) "Displacement (vector)"). In its simplest form, for a constant force aligned with the direction of motion, the work equals the [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_\(mathematics\) "Product (mathematics)") of the force strength and the distance traveled. A force is said to do _positive work_ if it has a component in the direction of the displacement of the [point of application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_application "Point of application"). A force does _negative work_ if it has a component opposite to the direction of the displacement at the point of application of the force.


1. **Force**: A vector quantity that causes an object to accelerate.
2. **Displacement**: The distance over which the force is applied.

**Mathematical Definition**: Work is defined mathematically as the scalar product of the force vector and the displacement vector. The equation is given by:

$W = \vec F \times \vec d = F \cdot d \cdot cos⁡(\theta)$, ie the [[Scalar Product (Dot Product)]] between the force vector and the displacement vector. 

where:

- $W$ is the work done,
- $\vec F$ the force vector,
- $\vec d$ the displacement vector,
- $F$ and $d$ are the magnitudes of the force and displacement vectors, respectively,
- $\theta$ is the angle between the force vector and the displacement vector.

**Characteristics of Work**:

- **Unit of Measure**: Work is measured in joules in the International System of Units (SI).
- **Significance of Direction**: The angle $\theta$ is crucial in calculating work. If the force is in the direction of movement, the cosine of the angle is $1 (cos(0°))$, and maximum work is done. If the force is perpendicular to the direction of movement $(cos(90°) = 0)$, no work is done, regardless of how much force is applied or how far the object moves.
- **Energy Transfer**: Work results in a transfer of energy. Positive work transfers energy to the object, while negative work (e.g., friction) takes energy away.

**Physical Interpretation**: Work can be thought of as the means by which energy is transferred from one system to another, often resulting in a change in velocity (kinetic energy), position (potential energy), or state (as in the work required to compress a gas).
