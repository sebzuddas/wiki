# What are Thermodynamics?
Thermodynamics focus on the transfer of [[Energy|energy]] within [[System|systems]]. This includes [[Heat|heat]], [[Work|work]] and 

# Laws of Thermodynamics
## 0. Thermal Equilibrium
If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then all three systems are in thermal equilibrium with one another. 

## 1. Law of Conservation of Energy
Energy cannot be created nor destroyed. Energy only transfers between systems or change its form. 

## 2. Law of Entropy
Heat does not spontaneously transfer from a cold body to a hot body. In other words, heat only flows from hot bodies to cold bodies. 

## 3. Law of Absolute Zero
As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero ($0\degree K = -273.15 \degree C$), all processes cease and the entropy of a system approaches a minimum value.
