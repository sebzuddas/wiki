## Goal 1 - Build Skills in Database Management

### Smart Objective 1 - Build foundational knowledge in FME, by performing the following tasks, within the next 2 months. 
1. Build a workspace to convert CAD files to geoJSON.
2. Build a workspace to perform geometric transformations, including scaling, rotating and translating spatial features. 
3. Build a workspace that filters spatial data based on dataset features, for example attaining all buildings taller than a certain height in a city. 
4. Build a workspace that aggregates spatial data, allowing the calculation of statistics such as number of figures and average figure value. 
### Smart Objective 2 - Build Foundational Knowledge in Database Management, by performing the following tasks, 
1. Constrain self to only using command line tools to perform tasks. 
2. Learn basic operations through using a server on your local computer. 
	1. Creating and deleting databases
	2. Creating, modifying and deleting tables. 
	3. Inserting, updating and deleting data in tables. 
3. Develop SQL Understanding
	1. Utilize `SELECT` statements.
	2. Understanding filtering and sorting of data. 
	3. Use `JOIN` statements, understand how different tables can be combined. 
	4. Use subqueries, aggregates and window functions. 
	5. Use `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses for data aggregation and filtering. 




## Goal 2 - Develop Competency in Research and Development Applying Concepts to Real-world Scenarios

### Smart Objective 1 - R&D Proposal Development
1. Develop research proposal documentation.

### Smart Objective 2- Remote Sensing
1. Develop a Remote sensing analytics methodology.
2. Leverage techniques such as Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Computer Vision (CV) for imagery and data acquired from remote sensing. 
3. Utilise the DSP and CV for: land classification, environmental analysis, natural hazard analysis, resource exploration, object detection.  
4. Develop tool for users via FME which leverages the above techniques. 
### Smart Objective 3 - Dynamic Systems Modelling and Control


Develop concept for Model Predictive Control - e.g. energy distribution in a building - reach out to Smart Buildings.
### Smart Objective 4 - Complex Systems Modelling & Simulation
2. Derive an Agent Based Model (ABM) of a city's mobility system. 
3. Use SysML to design the architecture of the model, ensuring it is compatible with currently developed Digital Twin architecture. 
4. Develop further SysML diagrams to validate the model against. 
5. Create unit tests to further validate the software aspect of the model. 
6. Simulate the ABM inside the Digital Twin.

## Goal 3 - Build on Project Management Skills
- Help with project management the PMs, involving scoping, tasking, timesheet management.Â Taking deliverable and developing into action plan.
- Look Vantagepoint database tables -see if a notification can be setup for hours remaining for that week, profit warnings.
- Apply systems thinking approach to optimize project management processes. 
- Contribute to retrospectives to identify areas of improvement for projects. 
- Develop skills in identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks in projects.
- Participate in leadership workshops or courses.
