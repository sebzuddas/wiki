# What is Work?
Work in physics is quantitative. **It defines the magnitude of energy that is associated with an object's displacement after subjecting it to an external force**. **work** is the [[Energy]] transferred to or from an [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_object "Physical object") via the application of [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") along a [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_\(vector\) "Displacement (vector)"). In its simplest form, for a constant force aligned with the direction of motion, the work equals the [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_\(mathematics\) "Product (mathematics)") of the force strength and the distance traveled. A force is said to do _positive work_ if it has a component in the direction of the displacement of the [point of application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_application "Point of application"). A force does _negative work_ if it has a component opposite to the direction of the displacement at the point of application of the force.
