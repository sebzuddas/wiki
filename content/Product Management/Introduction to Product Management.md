# Leading through influence
- Are the team happy?
- Being emotionally available within the team. 
- Does the team have clarity with the thing they're building?
- Always be open to *listen*. The team is expert in what they do. 
- 

# Who are the core team?
- UX
    - What does the product look like?
    - How does the customer use the product?
- Engineering
    - Build the product. 
- QA
    - Testing the product. 
    - Are the features used as intended?
- Marketing
    - Customers need to know what the product does. 

# Who are the extended team?
- Finance
- Legal
- Business Ops
    - interested in the TAM (total accessible market. Measured in currency.)
- Business Development
    - Will there be vendors? 
    - Are there collaborators?
- Execs and Investors
    - Will what you're building be successful? It's important to be able to convince these people. 
- Users
    - The most important group. 

# Agile vs Waterfall?
The creation is dependent on the product made. Are you building an app vs a physical device? This informs the development process. 

## Waterfall
- More appropriate for a physical device.
- Product details need to be articulated and consolidated before it is built. 

## Agile
- More appropriate for pure software. 


# Product Lifecycles
- Each product has a different lifecycle, often depending on whether your product warrants an agile vs a waterfall methodology. 
- It is important to flow between sprints. 

# Research
- It is important to create a strong reserach plan. 
- It needs to be an organised process. 
- Quantitative vs Qualitative. 
- Internal vs External. 
- Balancing these four factors are vital to conducting effective research. 

- Customer meetings
    - Can dive deeper than in a survey
    - What do they want?
    - When do they want it?
    - Look for actionable feedback.
    - In meetings, you are there to listen. 
    - Need a team scribe, where they write absolutely everything that the customer says. 
    - Keep the focus on the customer, create an environment where the customer shares. 
    - Fostering strong relationships. 
        - Introduce everyone.
        - Let the customer introduce themselves. 
        - Let the customer vent. 
        - Establish an active listening process as a result of the customer venting. 
        - Have the customer react to something you put in front of them. 
    - The pitching of a product depends on the product type. 
    - Don't answer the customers questions about the proposed project. This is because you may lead them. 
    - Respond with a question. 'how much do you expect?' 'What do you expect?'. 
    - Customers need to tell you what they want and what they don't
    - Create a list of features. They have £100 to spend on the features. Now, make them allocate where they want to 'spend' the money. 
        - Create a game with this - 'eliminate at least one feature', 'your minimum spend is x' 
    - Summarise a customer meeting asap after. Immediately sit down and summarise with the team, in private. 
        - What was the best thing you've heard?
        - What was the worst thing you've heard?
        - What went well? What didn't?
        - These help guide conversations with the next customer
    - Check for trends with the £100 test. 
    - Over the interview rounds, the product priorities will change. 
    - Organise the findings around the quadrant of reserach. 
    - Use critical questions from the customer meetings. 
    - Offer findings through internal white papers.
