# What is an Electricity System Operator?
An Electricity System Operator (ESO), also known as a Transmission System Operator (TSO) is an entity entrusted with transporting energy (natural gas or electricity) on a national level. In the UK, the ESO is the [National Grid](https://www.nationalgrideso.com/).

The ESO manages the [[energy]]  system, relying heavily on a combination of [[Electrical Engineering]] and [[Energy Market]].
