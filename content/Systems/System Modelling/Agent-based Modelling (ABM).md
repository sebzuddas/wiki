Agent-based modelling is an approach used to model [[Complex Adaptive Systems]], and is particularly useful in observing the [[Emergence]] of a system, based on the interactions between the agents. 
Work is being done to [initialise ABMs](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226383283_The_Integration_of_Agent-Based_Modelling_and_Geographical_Information_for_Geospatial_Simulation) with [[GIS#Raster|raster]] data.
