# Models

^c00c66

A model is a representation of either a process, product or system that improves understanding and promotes discussions.  ^31c1e5

# Systems
A system is an arrangement of component parts or elements that in combination exhibit behaviours or meanings that an individual component doesn't hold.  ^85c6a7  

# Modelling Systems from First Principles
Modelling systems from first principles relies using ideas from [[Dynamic Systems]] as defined by fundamental scientific principles, known as first principles. 

## Modelling Dynamics

## State-space Modelling

# Modelling Systems from Data
This is known as [[System Identification]].
