# What is Systems Engineering
Systems engineering is the discipline that brings together multiple engineering fields in order to deliver complex engineering projects and products. It is an interdisciplinary field that intersects technology and management, 

# Why do we need Systems Engineering

# How do I Engineer Systems
There are two notable approaches to following systems engineering processes, notably [[#Document-based Systems Engineering]] and [[#Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)]]. When implementing these approaches, the process typically follows a specific [[#Development Models|development model]]. **There is no one correct way to do systems engineering**, since each project/product has its own unique needs. Delivering 100 trains is different to delivering a robust telecommunication software. Software developers may initially jump to using agile,
