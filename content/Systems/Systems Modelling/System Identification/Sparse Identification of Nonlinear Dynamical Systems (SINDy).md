# What is SINDy?
Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (SINDy) is a relatively new (2016) [[System Identification]] technique. It uses an approach called Sparse Regression to find optimal parameters, a key difference to traditional system identification techniques. 

# Why use SINDy?
Although SINDy is only a method for conducting [[System Identification|system identification]], it is different enough from traditional techniques to warrant its own page. Whilst [[System Identification#^088a7d|NARMAX]] is an appropriate technique for nonlinear system identification, it has a key limitation. [[System Identification#^088a7d|NARMAX]] outputs an equation in the [[Laplace Transform#^9847d1|Laplace Domain]],
