Flexible system design means that a system can adequately respond to external changes, both internal and external, and does so in a time and cost effective manner. 


##### Manufacturing Systems
In the realm of manufacturing systems, flexibility has been separated into 11 different classes:
- **Machine flexibility** - The different operation types that a machine can perform.
- **Material handling flexibility** - The ability to move the products within a manufacturing facility.
- **Operation flexibility** - The ability to produce a product in different ways.
- **Process flexibility** - The set of products that the system can produce.
- **Product flexibility** - The ability to add new products in the system.
- **Routing flexibility** - The different routes (through machines and workshops) that can be used to produce a product in the system.
- **Volume flexibility** - The ease to profitably increase or decrease the output of an existing system. At firm level, it is the ability of a firm to operate profitably at different output levels. Firms often use volume flexibility as a benchmark to assess their performance vis-à-vis their competitors.
- **Expansion flexibility** - The ability to build out the capacity of a system.
- **Program flexibility** - The ability to run a system automatically.
- **Production flexibility** - The number of products a system currently can produce.
- **Market flexibility** - The ability of the system to adapt to market demands.
