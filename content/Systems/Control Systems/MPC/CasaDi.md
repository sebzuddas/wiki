# What is CasADi?
[CasADi](https://web.casadi.org) is a symbolic framework that uses [[Graph Theory|graph theory]] to enable users to easily handle nonlinear [[Optimisation|optimisation]] problems. CasADi can be implemented in programming languages such as [[Python]], [[MATLAB]] and [[C++]].

In CasaDi, mathematical operations are formulated as graphs, called *expression graphs*. Expression graphs enable CasaDi to be extremely computationally efficient compared to other mathematical symbolic frameworks, such as [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) or [MATLAB's symbolic toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/symbolic-computations-in-matlab.html).

# Why use CasADi?
CasADi is particularly useful because of its computational efficiency. It is a framework that facilitates the development of [[Model Predictive Control (MPC)]] approaches, due to the ease with which [[Optimal Control]] problems can be formulated using CasADi.
