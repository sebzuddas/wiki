Moving horizon estimation (MHE) is a type of optimisation-based [[Model Predictive Control (MPC)]] algorithm that is used to estimate the states of a system based on noisy measurements. It is an online algorithm that operates in a rolling horizon fashion, meaning that it continually updates the estimates of the states as new measurements become available.
