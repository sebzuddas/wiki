# What are Number Systems
Number systems are a way to represent quantities or values.

# [[Sets]] of Numbers
We can view number sets through the lens of human evolution. [[#Natural Numbers|natural numbers]] were used when human beings were still hunter gatherers, and thought of gathering and grouping physical things, such as apples. Then humans evolved to manage forms of surplus and scarcity, resulting in [[#Integers]], where some may have an excess of apples, and some may have a scarcity of apples (leading to zeros and negatives). Then human beings developed apple pies, but apple pies couldn't all be eaten by one person at once! So they invented [[#Rational Numbers]] to divide the apple pie into even pieces for the family. Then, human beings wanted to understand how big apple pies could get, and whether it was worth making [many small apple pies or one big apple pie](https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/2-medium-pizzas-vs-1-large/), hence they had to understand ratios and circles, leading to the discovery of $\pi$, hence the discovery of [[#Irrational Numbers]]. Grouping these sets of numbers together, we get [[#Real Numbers]]. But then [Rafael Bombelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Bombelli) in the 1500's asked the question "what happens when we $\sqrt{-1}$?" and came up with conventions to handle these numbers, leading to [[#Complex Numbers]].

## Natural Numbers
The natural numbers are represented by the sign $\mathbb N$. The intuition behind natural numbers is to represent quantities of physical things in reality. These are the first types of numbers that human beings considered. The natural numbers **do not contain zero!**

$$
\mathbb N =\{1, 2, 3, \dots, \infty \}
$$

For example, when counting the number of apples in a basket, you start from one and count to the number of apples that there are. 

> [!note]
> Natural numbers have no end. If you reach a maximum, then you can always 'add another'. For example, if you have 1000 apples in your basket, you can always *add one more*.  Although this may not be physically possible, it is *theoretically possible*. 



### Subsets of Natural Numbers
#### 1. Prime Numbers

## Integers
Integers are represented by the sign $\mathbb Z$. They are similar to natural numbers, but include negatives and zero. 

$$
\mathbb Z = \{ -\infty, \dots,  -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots, \infty  \}
$$
Integers are useful for describing things that *whole*. One person may have an excess of three apples $(3)$, and another may have a need for two apples, but doesn't have them yet $(-2)$. Integers can also be useful for describing things that 'step', such as [[Signal Processing|digital signals]]. 

## Rational Numbers
Rational numbers are represented by the sign $\mathbb Q$. Quotients represent *fractions*, being parts of whole numbers. 

$$
\mathbb Q = \{\frac{m}{n}: m, n\in \mathbb Z, n\neq 0 \}
$$
The above means that rational numbers are a fraction, with $m$ and $n$ being integers, and $n$ cannot be zero.
