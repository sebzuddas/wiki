# What are Number Systems
Number systems are a way to represent 

# Number [[Sets]]
## Natural Numbers
The natural numbers are represented by the sign $\mathbb N$. The intuition behind natural numbers is to represent quantities of physical things in reality. These are the first types of numbers that human beings considered. 

$$
\mathbb N =\{1, 2, 3, ... \}
$$

For example, when counting the number of apples in a basket, you start from one and count to the number of apples that there are. 

> [!note]
> Natural numbers have no end. If you reach a maximum, then you can always 'add another'. For example, if you have 1000 apples in your basket, you can always *add one more*.
