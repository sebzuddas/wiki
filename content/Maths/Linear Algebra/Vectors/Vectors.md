Vectors are a useful way to group together related properties *that cannot be expressed by a single number*. Although a physics class teaches that a vector is 'something with both magnitude and direction', such a description leads to thinking about vectors in a purely mechanical sense. 

# Why do we need Vectors?
Vectors are particularly useful when representing a number of things. 
## Data
In the world of AI & [[Machine Learning]], vectors and [[Matrices|matrices]] are useful mathematical tools used to manipulate data. 

## Modelling
When [[System Modelling|modelling systems]], vectors are useful tools to
