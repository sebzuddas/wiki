## Definition of a Positive Definite Matrix

- A symmetric matrix $Q$ is positive definite $\iff Q>0 \ \forall$ eigenvalues $\lambda >0$
- A symmetric matrix $Q$ is positive definite $\iff Q>0 \ \forall$ leading principle minors $>0$

## Definition of a Positive *Semi*-definite Matrix

- A symmetric matrix $Q$ is positive **semi -** definite $\iff Q>0 \ \forall$ eigenvalues $\lambda \ge0$
- A symmetric matrix $Q$ is positive **semi -** definite $\iff Q>0 \ \forall$ leading principle minors $\ge 0$ 


## Quadratic Form
Is used to map functions in the following manner: $\mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. In other words it turns $n$-dimensional matrices and turns them into scalars.
