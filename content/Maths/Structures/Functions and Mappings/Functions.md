# What is a Function?
## Basic Definition
A function is a mathematical operation that describes how a variable is altered, based on the inner workings of the function. Functions themselves can be thought of as processes, and by inputting a value to the process, we get the result of what the process does to the value. 

$$
x\rightarrow \fbox{function()} \rightarrow f(x)
$$
Above, the input $x$ is passed into the function $function()$. The result of inputting $x$ into the function is $f(x)$.

A function, formally, maps elements of one [[Sets|set]] to elements of another set.
