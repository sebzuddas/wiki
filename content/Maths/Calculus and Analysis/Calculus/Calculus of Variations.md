# What is the Calculus of Variations?
A branch of [[Calculus|calculus]] that deals with optimising [[Functions#^ccba29|functionals]]. It is mostly used to solve [[Optimisation|optimisation]] problems. Though the calculus of variations uses the same fundamental tools as conventional calculus, they are two domains that differ from one another. Whereas calculus focuses on changes regarding a function's *variables*, the calculus of variations focuses on changes in an *entire function* - hence the use of functionals.

# Why do we need the Calculus of Variations?
The calculus of variations is especially important for [[Lagrangian Mechanics]], [[Optimal Control]] and [[Geodesics]]. 


![[Functions#2. The Functional Analysis Definition of a Functional]]

See [[Functions#Examples of Functionals|examples of functionals]] for more on functionals. In the case of [[Optimal Control]] and [[Lagrangian Mechanics]], we are most interested in functionals who's integrands involve $\frac{dy}{dx}$, $y(x)$ or $x$. Hence, a general functional form we are interested in is:

$$
F(y) = \int_a^bf(x, y(x), \frac{dy(x)}{dx})
$$
