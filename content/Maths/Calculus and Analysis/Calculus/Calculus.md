# What is Calculus?
A branch of mathematics used to understand how values inside a [[Functions|function]] change. 


# Integrals 


# Functional Integrals


# Derivatives
Derivatives deal with *rates of change* of *variables* in a [[Functions|function]]. Functions can also become [[Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)]] and [[Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)]].

## [[Functions#Functionals|Functional]] Derivatives

Functional derivatives are analogous to ordinary derivatives. Whereas ordinary derivatives focus on the change in *function* with respect to a change in *variables*, functional derivatives consider the change in *functional* with respect to a *function*. 

Functional derivatives follow the structure:
$$
\frac{\delta F(y)}{\delta y}
$$
which describes the rate of change of a functional when the input is changed a little bit (hence the $\delta$).
