### Sounding Strategic 
- Add structure to your written and verbal comms. 
- Ensure the audience understands the core message. This is vital. 
- Prime the audience on what you're going to discuss (a bit like learning objectives) This way the audience can have a higher level conversation.
- Give the answer first, don't build up to the point. Explain how the answer is then arrived at.

### Seeking and Observing Trends
- Too much heads down leads to missing the bigger picture. 
- Requires context, and a solid understanding of the industry.
- Pay attention to common obstacles.
- Be upfront with colleagues and recurring problems.
- Understand the uniqueness of your experience and frame it on a wider scale.

### Assuming Appropriate Strategic Focus
- What are the strategic requirements of my role?
- Capacity to articulate the objective, scope, and advantage of a given thing in a single statement. 
- Uncover patterns to focus on resource investments. 
- 'without sound fact on where to allocate resources, squeeky wheels get the grease'
- For someone to follow through on your particular strategic decision on your behalf, they have to be invested, and believe in the strategy. 
- People's investment in the idea/project increases when they 'do the talking'

- How do small decisions contribute to the larger goal?
- Make decisions based on *reflection* not reflexes. 
Questions for reflection
	- What, Who was involved?
	- What, Who is at stake?
	- What are my misconceptions on risk and opportunity?
	- What are the links between people, plans, and ideas?
- Don't underestimate strategic relationships. 
- The strategic perspective is to see the world as a web of ideas, the strategy is the link between the nodes on the graph, and the weighting of vertices and edges is value/risk/whatever other variable. 
- The choices you make, as for which path in the graph to follow is your strategic judgement. The reason these choices are difficult is because they have real-world, sometimes unintended, consequences. 
- You are more strategic if you take action then course correct, as opposed to being stagnant. Don't be afraid to make decisions.

'What may happen?'
